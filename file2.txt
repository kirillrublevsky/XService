Common practices and programming models do not address important challenges 
inherent in designing systems for modern computer architectures. 
To be successful, distributed systems must cope in an environment where components crash without responding, 
messages get lost without a trace on the wire, and network latency fluctuates. 
These problems occur regularly in carefully managed intra-datacenter environments - 
even more so in virtualized architectures.
