All of these features are available through a uniform programming model: 
Akka exploits the actor model to provide a level of abstraction that makes it easier to write correct concurrent, 
parallel and distributed systems. 
The actor model spans the set of Akka libraries, providing you with a consistent way of understanding and using them. 
Thus, Akka offers a depth of integration that you cannot achieve by picking libraries to solve individual 
problems and trying to piece them together.
